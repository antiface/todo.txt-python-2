This is a simple Python library for reading and writing todo.txt files (i.e.,
the dirt-simple text format used by the todo.txt bash script by Gina Trapani:
todotxt.com). Mostly it is an excuse for me to brush up on TDD in
Python. 

This library was developed in conjunction with the tracks-python library, for
interfacing with Tracks instances (Tracks is a GTD todo list web application:
https://github.com/TracksApp/tracks), and is included as a sub-project in the
Tracks-Sync extension for todo.txt
(https://github.com/tristil/Todo.txt-Tracks-Sync). The reason for using Python
for this integration was to have a todo.txt parsing library that wasn't written
 in Bash but which would run on most Linux servers.

Major caveats for using this library are:

* It may not see much more active development.
* I didn't implement anything with regard to Priority.
* I don't understand relative module inclusion in Python very well. There's a
lot of appending the path of the parent directory to the paths list.
* There might be a hard dependency on the Tracks module.
* If you run this on your beloved todo.txt files, be sure to MAKE A BACKUP
first. It could very well erase or jumble your data.

If somebody actually has a use for this library and has additional
requirements/ bugs / patches, go ahead and submit them as Github issues and I
will respond to them as quickly as possible.
